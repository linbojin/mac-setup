Setting up a development environment on Mac OS X

## System preferences

In **Apple Icon > System Preferences**:

- Trackpad > Tap to click
- Keyboard > Key Repeat > Fast (all the way to the right)
- Keyboard > Delay Until Repeat > Short (all the way to the right)
- Dock > Automatically hide and show the Dock

## Google Chrome

Download: [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html).

## iTerm2

Download: [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/)

Let's just quickly change some preferences. In **iTerm > Preferences...**, under the tab **General**, uncheck **Confirm closing multiple sessions** and **Confirm "Quit iTerm2 (Cmd+Q)" command** under the section **Closing**.

In the tab **Profiles**, create a new one with the "+" icon, and rename it to your first name for example. Then, select **Other Actions... > Set as Default**. Finally, under the section **Window**, change the size to something better, like **Columns: 125** and **Rows: 35**.

When done, hit the red "X" in the upper left (saving is automatic in OS X preference panes). Close the window and open a new one to see the size change.


## Homebrew

Package managers make it so much easier to install and update applications (for Operating Systems) or libraries (for programming languages). The most popular one for OS X is [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/).

### Usage

To install a package (or **Formula** in Homebrew vocabulary) simply type:

    $ brew install <formula>
        
To update Homebrew's directory of formulae, run:

    $ brew update

To see if any of your packages need to be updated:

    $ brew outdated
    
To update a package:

    $ brew upgrade <formula>
        
Homebrew keeps older versions of packages installed, in case you want to roll back. That rarely is necessary, so you can do some cleanup to get rid of those old versions:

    $ brew cleanup

To see what you have installed (with their version numbers):

    $ brew list --versions


## Apps

Here is a quick list of some apps I use, and that you might find useful as well:

- [Spectacle](https://www.spectacleapp.com/): Move and resize windows with ease.
- [MWeb](http://www.mweb.im/): Markdown writing, note taking and static blog generator App
- [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/): File syncing to the cloud. I put all my documents in Dropbox. It syncs them to all my devices (laptop, mobile, tablet), and serves as a backup as well! **(Free for 2GB)**
